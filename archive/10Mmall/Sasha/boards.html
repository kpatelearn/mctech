    <h1><p class="solid">LONGBOARD $520 | Longboards are suitable for a long surfing session without getting too tired, especially if one doesn't have so much experience catching and paddling for waves, because it does not require such strength to catch the wave or paddle back to the peak.</p></h1></h1>

    <h2>Great board for a long surf! Was super easy to use the first time I tried it, didn't have to do much work at all. LOVE!</h2>

    <h2>I love coming home to this board after a long day at work, you don't have to put much effort into it at all!</h2>

    <h1><p class="solid">MALIBU $600 | Turns, floaters, nose rides, and walking the deck can all be accomplished on a Malibu. Such maneuvers are what more accomplished surfers love, so the Malibu is great for advanced riders too. Less cumbersome than a classic 9' or 10' longboard, a Malibu is perfect for a progressive longboarder.</p></h1>

    <h1><p class="solid">GUN $530 | Gun surfboards are designed for much bigger waves. So big a wave that most beginner surfers have never ridden in conditions where they might need a gun surfboard.</p></h1>

    <h1><p class="solid">FUNBOARD $580 | Funboards combine the ease of paddling a longboard with the responsiveness of a shortboard. They are great for teaching you shortboard maneuvers like bottom turns and cutbacks. In addition, funboard surfboards work well in most surf conditions.</p></h1>

    <h1><p class="solid">SHORTBOARD $540 | Shortboards are ideal for advanced maneuvers like airs, snaps, cutbacks, etc. Their strong rocker (the curve, or “banana” shape of the surfboard from nose to tail), makes it much easier to “hit” critical parts of the wave, as the surfboard's shape “fits” the shape of a breaking wave.</p></h1>

    <h1><p class="solid">FISH $590 | The fish surfboard is also highly capable at catching waves in small wave situations because of the wide template at the tail. There's more planing surface to keep you afloat. A wide tail also provides great drive down line, which is very important when the waves are small.</p></h1>

    <h2>I have so much fun with this board! Catching nice and small waves as a beginner with this board is the best! Smoothest and straightest board i've used so far!</h2>
    <h3>- @ChelseaNoble_SeaLover</h3>
    <h2>This board was great the last time I used it, but definitly would want a bigger board for catching bigger waves, not the right choice for big waves.</h2>
