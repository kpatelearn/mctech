    <p>The Karala is a rare, fun-loving animal found on the McGey Islands. 
      The karala is a friendly animal, but It can get fiesty when its 
      neighbouring animal, the agnes, is offended. Karalas are natural 
      preditors to the Meergats and the Savgulls. Karalas will sleep 
      anywhere: on the floor, in a tree, anywhere! The Karalas only take dust
      baths once every three weeks and, overall, are pretty independent. 
      DO NOT BUY THE KARALA IF YOU HAVE A CAT. Karalas love
      cats and will steal them and run away.  </p>
