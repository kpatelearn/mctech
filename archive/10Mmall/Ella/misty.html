        misty is a great cat, she has just come back from the hospitel and is in the proseses of recovering from a major operation. due to this she isent allowed to come out much as she needs to rest but trust us if she could she would. misty loves cuddles and will like to just sit next to you and feel you presents. she is 5 years old and due to her condition she can not currently be adopted but hopfully in a few months she will be recovered so you are welcome to fill in a application though keep in mind she will require a lot of vet trips which can cost a lot. she like many of out cats is a classic british short haired. she has the sweetist gray colouring which is calm just like her. she is a very peaceful cat and has a sweet calm personality like a classic cat. when shes can come out she spents all her time sitting next to people begging for hugs and make sure you give her lots.
