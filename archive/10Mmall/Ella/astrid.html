        astrid is the sweetist cat we have ever seen , she is also out newest cat and we only got her 3 weeks ago. she is 2 years old and is adapting great to the cafe life and she seems to really love it here, while we are not activly looking someone to adopt him if you feel out the form we will contact you if we learn he is more suited to a home or just if she gets to old/sick to be in the cafe. she like many of out cats is a classic british short haired. she has amazing mix of colours and pattens on her fur and the way it changes colour in the sun is gorgeous. we can speak much on his personality yet as we are just getting to know him but from what we can see she seems to be rather playful and happy. her faviote place keeps changing so we will have to wait a little longer to see were she chooses.
