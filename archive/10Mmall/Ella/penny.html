        penny is a wonderful cat, she is a ginger kitten who is only 1 month old. she like many of out cats is a classic british short haired. she has beautiful colouring with the softest fur we have ever seen, the ginger and white mix perfectly giving her the perfect little tabby patten. she is our youngest cat and therefore she is not available for adoptions yet but you can still fill out the form now and we will get back to you when she is old enough to be adopted. in the later years she has stopped coming out as much and spents most of her time sleeping in the back but when she does join us she is a plesure to have around and would never hurt a fly. shes likes to sleep on the top of the scratching post or anywhere high as if she had to prove she can be powerful even though she is tiny.
