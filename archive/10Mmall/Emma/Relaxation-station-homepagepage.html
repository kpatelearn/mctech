<p>You’re doing an amazing job for making it this far! Now it’s time to take a 10 minute rest from all that study you’ve been doing. It’s extremely important to take breaks when you’re working so that you don’t get burnt out. Research shows that taking purposeful breaks (anywhere from 5–60 minutes) from studying refreshes your brain and body, it increases your energy, productivity, and ability to focus as well<br><br><br><br>

   <ul>
      Here’s your checklist of things to do:<br>
      <li>Drink water, I know everyone says it but there’s a reason for it<br></li>
      <li>Have your bathroom break now so you don’t have to break your study cycle later<br></li>
      <li>Have a small snack<br></li>
      <li>If you’re feeling really stressed out right now you can listen to a podcast or some guided meditation<br><br><br><br><br></li>
   </ul>
</p>

   10 Minute Guided Meditation for Focus - YouTube<br><br><br><br><br>



   We also offer hot/cold drinks and guided meditation (with real people, not just videos) in store with relaxing music.<br><br><br>

   <ul>
      Study tips! <br>
      <li>You can use the pomodoro technique, this means working for around 30-60 minutes at a time and then taking a 5-15 minute break before repeating the process <br></li>
      <li>Always have water nearly, it keeps your mind refreshed<br></li>
      <li>If you’re studying for an upcoming exam or assessment make flashcards to test your knowledge<br></li>
      <li>You can try teaching other people<br></li>
      <li>You need to sleep properly or your brain won’t function with full concentration, try getting to bed at an earlier time rather than doing an all nighter because your brain won't be refreshed and you won't be contributing your best work<br></li>
      <li>Break it down into smaller chunks so it’s easier to work with<br></li>
      <li>Ask for help if you’re stuck, friends, older siblings that have done the topic before (maybe not your parents because they might not understand but if they offer to help don’t say no)<br></li>
   </ul>
