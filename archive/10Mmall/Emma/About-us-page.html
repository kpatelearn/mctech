         We are Study night. What makes us any different from any other tutoring services you’ve heard of before? Well, we’ve been created by a student that knows just what other students need when they study. Instore we have 5 rooms that you will be led through, three of them are dedicated to science labs (Chemistry, Physics and Biology) and the final space is the break room (a.k.a. The Relaxation Station)
         <br><br>
         It was a late night in 2022 when a young student named Emma Maunsell was working on her science homework and as she re-read the same paragraph for the 14th time she thought to herself “surely there has to be an easier way to do this, some company that specialises in this” she searched and searched but to no avail, there was no help to be found. That’s when she was struck by an idea “why can’t I be the first? I’ll make a store where students can study outside of school” and so it began. She created study night by coding a website (the one you’re on right now) and expanded her horizons from there, eventually opening up her very own store in 10Mall.
         <br><br>
         Emma wanted to expand the meaning of study, past boring tutoring and sitting down at a desk staring blankly at a screen, she wanted to make it fun. Being a student herself she wanted her store to be relatable and just what teens need right now, she has provided tuition on three different sciences where she has hired real teachers and students get the opportunity to teach classes every so often too (but it’s not forced), there is a seperate space where students go to relax after a long time studying.
         <br><br>
         Study night is a safe space for students to work and study and they will be supported in their learning journeys.
