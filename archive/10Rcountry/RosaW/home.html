        <h2>Welcome to Vilivil Village's Website</h2>
        <h3>History of the Village and it's Occupants</h3>
        <p>Vilivil village is located in a rainforest in 10 R's country, Tenarvia. 
            It is an eight hour drive from the closest city, Maddiegascar. 
            It is part of the purgamentum region in the far west of Tenarvia.
             Vilivil village was once part of Tenarvia, but became an independent establishment when the tribe that first occupied the village (The Vilvilians) set loose a horde of wild silverback gorillas in the newly opened city hall. 
             The Vilvilians took back control of their town for a short while, until their gorillas turned on them and ran them  out of town, leaving them stranded in the rainforest, they shortly perished. 
             The gorillas now live happily in desolate Vilivil, and not a single soul has bothered them for 50 years. 
             The gorillas evolved and became so intelligent they have a higher brain function than humans. They elected a leader to be king, his name is King Bong. 
             The gorillas are vegetarian and live off the land. They are a very agricultural community, as they are surrounded by wildlife and diverse plant species. 
             They were inspired to build a greenhouse, in which they grow plants which are used for medicinal purposes. 
             There are some misconceptions about the gorillas, all of Tenarvia believe they are violent aggressive creatures who want to take over the country. 
             They think because they left the Vilvilians to die all alone in the jungle 50 years ago, that they are bad, but this is simply not true. 
             The gorillas are just chill dudes who spread peace and love, and want unity between all of Tenarvia.
