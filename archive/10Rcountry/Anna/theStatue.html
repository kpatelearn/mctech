        <p1>The statue has been a very popular attraction throughout the years. 
          Not only does it attract tourists, but is very popular amongst locals!
           Many people travel far to see the statue in person. It was made in 1390 which makes it even more astounding. 
           Scientists and historians believe that this statue was created after a little weird girl who lived in those days. 
           Her name was Amby and she was just a normal kid like all others. That was until one day when a moment changed everything.
            Amby wasn't a very smart kid and was walking home from playing in the lake. However, she didn't return home that night. 
            Everyone was heartbroken. At the time, the city was very small only made of less than 100 people and they were all friends. 
            When Amby didn't return home, everyone was shocked, nothing like this ever happens in sunny sun city. 
            So, to remember her, they decided to make a statue. 
            But, to their surprise, Amby returned home a few days later!! 
            Turns out, when she was walking through the woods, she saw a cat and thought it was a good idea to follow it! 
            She ended up getting lost and didn't know how to get back. 
            She had never bothered to learn how to navigate using the sun or stars so she was left alone wondering the woods until she eventually found her way back!
