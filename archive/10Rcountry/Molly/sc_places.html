    The pictures above depict just a few of the thousands of alien raves that take place in Starlight city. Every few miles you walk, there is garunteed to be a rave
     building. In fact, about 97% of the buildings in starlight city are rave houses. The raves consist of hundreds of aliens in crowds, packed together
     while dancing to their favourite music, getting autographs signed by their favourite artists, eating their favourite foods and sometimes shooting each other to death.
    Now that sounds fun!
