<h3>Skye's backstory: </h3> 

When Skye was born, she was the most beautiful and perfect baby that anyone had seen. But, she had a secret. <br>
Skye was evil! She has big red eyes and her powers were extremely strong as a child. Her parents never told anyone, <br>
they wanted everyone to think that they had the perfect child. But secretly, they were raising a devil. <br>
When Skye turned 11, her parents abandoned her because she was too difficult to raise. When Skye woke up the next <br>
day and found out her parents had left her, she became furious. <br>
She searched for her parents for 3 weeks untill she finally found them living in a secret hut underground. <br>
While they were asleep, she killed them. Skye grew up the rest of her life alone and convinced everyone she was the <br>
sweetest girl in Superhero city, but it was all a lie. Skye was Superhero city's secret villan.
