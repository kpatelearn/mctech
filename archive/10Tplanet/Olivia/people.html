  <p> The people of Steorra, called the Arvarians, are a proud people, secretive, although peaceful and friendly enough. They maintain a healthy relationship with Humans, although the consider us vain and not atune with nature as them.

    <br>

    The Arvarians are humaoids, and look like a cross between humans and birds. They are taller than most humans, have sharper teeth and oddly coloured eyes, which sometimes number more than two. They have colourful, bird-like wings that are usually bigger than them. <br> <br> The Arvarians enjoy a special relationship with nature and their surroundings, and have a tendency to leave nature untouched and alone, resulting in a planet teeming with plants and animals. They consider humans as odd and below them for not respecting nature as they should. <br> <br> The Arvarians are not only proud of their respect of nature, but also their wings. They often show them off and adorn them in ornaments and flowers and other things they deem pretty enough, and often the higher your rank is the larger and more decorated your wings are. The ARvarians also love flying competitions, whether competitive or casual, along with gardening,creating and acting in plays, and of course decorating their wings. 
 
    <br> <br>
     
    The Arvarians' unique relationship to nature also affects their daily lives - they live in trees, to feel even closer to it. Many of them often build treehouses or use the hollow trunks of the tree, but some Arvarians will use the tree branches as perches and build nests there. Some Arvarians are also entirely nomadic, either living on land or sailing in boats across the vast ocean, and only settle down into nests to raise their young.
