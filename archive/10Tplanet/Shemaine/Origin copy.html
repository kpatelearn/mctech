            This planet was discovered 100s of years ago by a small group of female aliens from planet Cebronix. <br>
            The 3 girls got lost in outer space and ended up on Planet Her where they started their own world <br>
            for female aliens to be themselves without any males because that would make the planet a damgerous <br>
            place. This is because a long long time ago, the male and female aliens were at war and unfortunately <br>
            it wiped out almsot half the population of female aliens in the UNIVERSE! <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            - Every year the planet releases lanterns as a celebration on the 24th May because <br>
            <br>
            that was the day Planet Her was discovered <br>
            <br>
