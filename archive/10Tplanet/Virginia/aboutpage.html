        <p id="intro">Welcome to Victorious, the best & most glamorous planet you will ever see.
 
            As you can tell by the name, this planet is the most Victorious of it all.
 
            Victorious aka Vic is the farthest-known solar planet from the sun. It is also the 6th biggest planet. The planet is the same size as Earth & is a lot similar to Earth like: species, land/nature, & the lifestyles of the species ect.  
 
            Victorious was discovered a long long long time ago by myself: Ms. Virginia Manukia.
 
            I came up with the name because it was just a describing word that went with my name, however I did like the dominance & confidence that the word gives.
 
            Vic is referred to as an imperial & rather distinctive planet compared to other planets.  
 
            On Vic, you will see some pathways made of rose quartz crystals which is what makes the planet special. You can find buildings with burmese rubies at the tippy top, the ruby itself shines at night like a lighthouse light.  
 
            Just like Earth, Victorious has seasons but accepts there is no Autumn.  
 
            There is only Summer, Spring, & Winter. Although Winter here is quite strange because its not as super cold & yucky, it does snow though.

        <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>The Atmosphere</b></h1>
        <p> As mentioned before, Victorious is very similar to Earth.
          Victorious is composed of about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases: discovered amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and neon are some of the other gases that make up the remaining 0.1 percent.
          Victorious’ average distance from the sun is about 2.8 billion miles & has 10 moons.
          It also has 15 satellites. The diameter of the equator is 30,707 miles. The length of the day for the planet is 16.11 earth hours & is the sidereal rotation. Tilt of the axis is also 28.32 degrees.

        <h1 class="xlarge-font"><b>Species</b></h1>
        <p> Like Earth, Victorious has a wide range of species. 
          Obviously including humans, which would be at the top of the list.. um of course.
          Yes, boys + girls & other identities, different races.
          We have animals here like animals, which brings me to a point. We have this weird invention on Victorious: before animals are born, humans or the owner of this animal can literally design this animal, I mean like personalize it - in a respectful animal manner. 
          Other than that, we also have rare talking animals which come with the personalizing part.
          The bestest part is that we have mermaids & fairies. 
          Mermaids - have their own specialized pools but they can literally swim anywhere & they can also turn human if they wanted to, a bit like H20 just add water. They have the same powers as the characters in the teenage series too. 
          
          Fairies -  have their own specialized floating mansions & castles. Fairies have all technology powers, they’re always there when you have a fashion, makeup, hair emergency.
          
          Bratz - We also our very special Bratz, no not the dolls, the real deal. They're one of the most welathiest people on the planet, the reason why we call them "people" is because they are so much like humans but much much more glamorous.
