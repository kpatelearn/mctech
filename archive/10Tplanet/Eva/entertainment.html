<h1> ENTERTAINMENT!</h1>
<hr> 
<body>
   <h2> The entertainment that i liked the sound of the most was Parrot park and Cats and Dogs amusement park
        Parrot park would be amazing because at Parrot park you would be able to go and adopt a Parrot,
    or just go look at them and teach them how to talk to you say your name etc. <br> <br> 
    And i found cats and dogs amuesment park really cool as a place where you could go hang out for the day and the carriages on the rollercoaster/rides would be the shape of Cats and Dogs. 
   And of course cats and dogs boxing and rabbit wrestling every saturday and sunday night!
Where you can go eat dinner/snacks and watch rabbits wrestle and cats and dogs do boxing 
And see who will win the giant prize at the end. </h2>
