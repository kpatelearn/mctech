<h1>TRAVELING!</h1>
 <hr> 
<body>
    <h2>
        How you get from place to place is by teleporting, flying cars,flying pet llamas, 
        and if you want to get from planet to planet you can take bird flights instead of rocketship flights. 
        Flying cars sounds very fun because on planet eslie all of the cars have special buttons 
        where you can choose to either fly in the air or drive normally across the road if air traffic gets to busy. <br> <br> 

        Flying pet llamas is cool on planet Eslie because they can fly you from planet to planet like a rocket. 
        And last but not least time traveling, time traveling is the best because when you are in a hurry, 
        you can just push a button on your phone and it will take you from your house to anywhere including to places
        where there is a emergency.
