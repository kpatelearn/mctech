<h1> HOUSING!</h1> 

 
<hr> 
<p> 
<h2> On Planet Eslie some of the houses are trees with windows and staircases inside it is literally
pretty much a normal house just inside a tree theres everything you could possibly need! Including food and water,
 and alot of branches to hang a swing on. <br> <br>
 There are also houses in the shape of a rose, pretty much the same as the "treehouse" just in a small rose. 
 The rose houses are mainly for little kids playhouses
as they are quite small but some are big enough for a family to live in. If you want a really fancy house
you can opt for a Castle that is big enough for any family. <h2>
