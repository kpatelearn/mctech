    <h2>The first thing you're taught when you come to Acuatica is how to walk on water. <br>
        It's really important you know how to, because it's the most common way of getting around.

    <h2>The creatures on Acuatica had to adapt to the world being mostly water, so they're able to breathe underwater. <br>
        It seems hard, but once you're taught how to, its actually very easy.
