    <h3> Xena is a very old but wealthy planet. It has a lot of beautiful nature such as mountains and rivers, but Xena is most famous for the bridges in the sky. Xena was founded hundreds of years ago by humans on Earth. Humans realised that Xena had perfect living conditions and it was very similar to earth. The humans decided they were going to send prisoners to this planet to keep them far away from everyone else, but this backfired. The prisoners started building homes, schools ect. Now, Xena is the wealthiest, smartest planet in the solar system. Humans on Earth still send prisoners to Xena thinking they are living in horrible conditions, but little do they know its the exact opposite. You often can't trust Xena's citezens, because they are all criminlas they often do sneaky things that you wouldn't expect.</h3>
