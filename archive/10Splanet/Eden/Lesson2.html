    <h3>Can We Talk - Tevin Campbell</h3>
    <p> 
    <b>Last night I
        I saw you standing
        And I started
        Started pretending
        I knew you and you knew me too
        And just like a Roni
        You were too shy
        But you weren't the only
        'Cause so was I
        And I've dreamed of you ever since
        Now I've built up my confidence
        Girl next
        Next time you come my way
        I'll know just what to say</p>
        <p>Can we talk for a minute?
            Girl, I want to know your name
            Can we talk for a minute?
            Girl, I want to know your name</p>
    <p>I started
        To write you letters
        But I wanted
        To be more clever
        I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
        Hey baby
        But just like a baby I could not talk
        And I tried to come closer but could not walk
        And I think of it every night
        How I just could not get it right
        If we ever come close again
        I know what I'll say then, yeah</p>
    <p>Can we talk for a minute?
        Girl, I want to know your name
        Can we talk for a minute?
        Girl, I want to know your name</p>
    <p>Oh, girl
        One more chance
        With you again
        I will not let it go
        Oh, please
        Give me just one more chance
        For love, love, love, love</p>
    <p>Can we talk for a minute?
        Girl, I want to know your name
        Can we talk for a minute?
        Girl, I want to know your name</p>
    <p>Can we talk for a minute?
        Come on and talk to me baby
        Say I want to know
        Can we talk for a minute?
        Girl, I want to know your name
        Can we talk for a minute?</p>
    <p>I said can we talk for a minute
        Come on and talk to me baby
        See I wanna know
        You better tell your name, baby</p>
    <p>Can we talk for a minute?
        I said talk to me for a minute
        Come and talk for a minute
        I wanna know, I wanna know
        I wanna know your name</p>
    <p>Can we talk for a minute?
        Talk to me for a minute
        Come and talk for a minute
        Come on, come on, come on and talk to me, yeah</p>
