            <h4><u>Computer:</u> As an introduction to the Raspberry Pi, I created a computer for my younger brothers. I set up their own logins and passwords, and installed as many of their favourite games as I could, since not all of them were compatible with the Raspberry Pi. <br>

                <u>Smart mirror:</u> After getting accustomed to using a Raspberry Pi, I created a smart mirror for my friend using the program "Magic Mirror 2". It displays her timetable for the day and shows all of the upcoming birthdays or important anniversaries of her friends and family. <br>
                
                <u>Program:</u> For my programming internal, I created a text-based game where a player has to find a trophy hidden somewhere in the webpage. After that, the game launches into a "choose your own adventure" style game with 5 possible endings you can reach. I love these kinds of games where the choices you make affect the story, so I had a lot of fun working on this project. If the player is experiencing any difficulty with finding the Trophy, they can type "Hint" into the answer bar. If they're still having trouble finding the trophy, click the button below. **Please add a button that will show this text if a user click on it because it has spoilers** "ctrl shift j". <br>
                
                <u>Video:</u> I created a trailer for one of the music compositions my friend Isabelle made. It's called "Where The Heavens Touch Us" and it will be featured on the Marist College 2022 Album. Since the music had a space concept, I used as many space-related motifs as I could to make the music video.
