    <h1> Activities</h1>

<p>In upside down town there is lots fun things to do. 
    Our most popular place for tourists to visit is the bird swimming pool.</p>
    <p>I know the name bird swimming pool doesnt sound too apitising to most people, it is very clean and the birds are very friendly. 
        Its the perfect idea to cool off after a hot day. Make sure to bring your goggles.</p>
