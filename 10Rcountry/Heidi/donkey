    <h1>Heidi is Amazing </h>
        <h6>Half-past twelve
            And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
            How I hate to spend the evening on my own
            Autumn winds
            Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
            And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
            There's not a soul out there
            No one to hear my prayer
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
            Movie stars
            Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
            It's so different from the world I'm living in
            Tired of TV
            I open the window and I gaze into the night
            But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
            There's not a soul out there
            No one to hear my prayer
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            There's not a soul out there
            No one to hear my prayer
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
            Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
            Take me through the darkness to the break of the day </h6>
