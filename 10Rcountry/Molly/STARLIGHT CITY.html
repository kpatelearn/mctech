<p>Starlight city is a location set in space. A strange wormhole opened up in a desolate area of Tenarvia,
     and on the other side, explorers found a cosmic civilization in another galaxy, light years away from earth. 
     The creatures who inhabited Starlight city had created a network of paths and tunnels between a cluster of stars,
      and survived by the solar energy they gave off.

<div id="ohmagooud">
    <p> The wormhole would appear once a year, in the same place, on the same date, the 24th of June. Because of this date, 
        and the portal to a space civilization, Starlight city is believed to be linked to Matariki. The wormhole’s location 
        is appropriately called “The gate to Starlight city” and is located on the coast near the Bavanahs. To this day, nobody knows how the wormhole appeared.
