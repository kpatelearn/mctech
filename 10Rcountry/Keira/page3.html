<h4> Kyla's super power is being able to multiply.</h4> 
Kylas parents divorced, they were in different cities when they were both killed by Superhero cities <br>
hidden villan. The funerals were held on the same day so she had to make a choice of which parents funeral she would <br>
go to. Kyla couldn't make up her mind so she started to reaserch. She had only a week untill the funerals so she <br>
had to work hard and fast. <br>
After 5 days of planning and testing, she finally did it. Kyla had made a formula to make herself mulitply. <br>
She managed to go to both her parents funerals and months later she decided to use her multiplying formula for good. <br>
Kyla became a mutiplying superhero and mulitiplys herself to do many things at 1 time.
