    <h1>Aquacity - City of Tenarvia </h1>

    <h2>See above the sky and under the water in the same buildings</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>Welcome to the official website of Aquacity. Our city has an accesible road to "Upside down town", "School city", and "Superhero city.
        Our buildings are very unique and are half submerghohed in water and half reaches above clouds. Each and every one of our buildings have 
        glass windows (which are top quality and very strong - bulletproof - shatterproof - waterproof) so that when you are in the lower half
        of a building you can see all the fish swimming around and our healthy corals on the seabed. When you are on the upper half, you can 
        see the view of the amazing lake we are based on and the forest surrounding it. </p>

        <p> Our city is filled with apartment buildings - we have lots of options so you can find the apartment for you. Even if you are only staying
        for a few days, we want your days to be memorable!</p>

        <p> To occupy yourself during your stay - we have multiple attractions for you to visit. There are a cluster of buildings in the centre of the city
        with the apartments in the outer corners.</p>
