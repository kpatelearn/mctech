        The song of the Wailing Tooka is a loud, complex series of sounds repeated over and over. It occurs primarily (although not exclusively) during the breeding season, is sung only by males, and its composition changes as it is being sung with all singers in a population singing the same version at any one time. <br> <br>

With their charismatic nature, they enjoy performing these songs (or ‘wails’ as scientists call them) too large groups of Lowland Woc and Wild Boar.<br>
