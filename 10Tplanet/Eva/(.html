    <h1> Meet Eslie! </h1> 

    <P> 

        <hr>  

         <h3> the amazing planet created by Eva Mitchell. </h3> 

        <h2> Eslie is a beautiful planet that is rose gold, with a atmosphere that is turquoise. the atmosphere  

         is a calming turquoise colour filled with little stars.  

          

         Eslie has alot of cool entertainment like Cats and Dogs boxing and bunny wrestling.  

        it is a quiet, worry free planet with only a few people and animals.  

        The houses can be in the shape of a rose, or a house inside of a tree. On planet eslie there is freshly green grass, 

        Nice,brisk cold weather with a ltitle bit of sunshine and of course alot of oxygen to keep everything alive. 

         how you get from place to place is  by teleporting, flying cars,flying pet llamas,  

         and if you want to get from planet to planet you can take bird flights instead of rocketship flights.  

         one very cool power that everyone has on planet eslie is that you can talk to animals and make conversation with them/ 

        understand what they are saying.
