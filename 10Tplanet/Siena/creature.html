<h1> Humans</h1>
<h2> Humans are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, <br> characterized by bipedalism and large,
     complex brains. This has <br>enabled the development of advanced tools, culture, and language.<br> They are
     the main reason Cebronix thrives and continues to be high <br> power against enemy planets today.</h2>

    <h1> Vampires</h1>
    <h2> Vampires are creatures that feast on all living creatures on Cebronix.<br> Most vampires are able to control
        themselves but some cant and they can <br>be so deadly that towns in Cebronix have to evacuate to have a good shot at <br>
        staying alive
    </h2>
