    <h2> The planet Cebronix was created 1 Quintillion years ago.<br> It came to be when 2 Gods, Shemaini and Willini
        got into <br> a big argument and used their powers against eachother. <br> Shemaini's power is having mystical matter appear whenever <br> 
        and  Willini's being she can spawn anything his mind thinks <br> of. Willini thought of Nuclear matter and when it met <br>
        with Shemaini's mystical matter the planet CEBRONIX formed.
