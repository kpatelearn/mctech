    <h3>Millions of years ago, Acuatica was just like Earth. There were citys and blue skies. But slowly the water level started rising and the sky started turning orange. <br>
        Now, the whole plant is underwater and the sky gives the illuison that its a pretty sunset, but it's just the smoke in the sky. <br>
        The planet was renamed from Tierra, which is land in Spanish, to Acuatica, which is water in Spanish.
