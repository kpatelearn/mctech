   <h1> Tardonia Environment</h1>

    <br> <br>

    <p id="p1" > This is what the sky looks like at night. <br> <br> One day on Tardonia lasts 11 hours, there are 14 months in a year, each month lasts 64 days and 1 
        year lasts 896 days. <br> The weather here is mainly cold and windy. <br> <br> 
        The planet gets it's purple colour from the dust particles of Planet Purtopia (Willow's Planet). Tardonia started off as an abandoned asteroid and as the Purtopia
        dust particles travelled to the asteroid, it grew to become this round planet. The feeling of this surface is rocky and sandy. <br> <br> There are 2 types of trees
        on Tardonia, the purple trees are called Wild Dark oak trees and the pink trees are called Redbud Blossom trees. They both grow small fruits that are berry like but 
        scientists have still to discover what they are.</button> </p>
