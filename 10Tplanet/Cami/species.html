    <h3 id="head" > Telxa Aliens:</h3>
    <p id="p1" > These purple Aliens are called Telxas. They have a round flat head with 2 antennnas, big oval eyes,
    a short neck, a circular body with 2 arms and 4 fingers and legs with their feet shaped like a V. They are herbivores and
    they eat the leaves from the trees. They can grow up to 7 feet tall and their weight can range from 80 - 120kgs. They have a 
    thick layer of fur around their body so they don't get cold.</p> <br> <br>

    <h3 id="head2" > Dortella Ants:</h3>
    <p id="p2" > These arn't your regular black ants. Dortella Ants have prickly light purple antennas, thin purple wings and 
    the back part of their body is furry, it is dark purple in the day and it glows bright at night. In the back part of 
    their body, they have neon substances, this is useful for them at night time. As you can see in the picture below, they are also 
    a mode of transport for the Telxa Aliens.  </p> <br> <br>

    <h3 id="head3">Spindle Butterflies:</h3>
    <p id="p3" >These spieces of butterflies are called Spindles. They don't really do much except flying around and looking pretty.
    They are very delicate and they are all different shapes and sizes. Something they do love to do is spin around in circles and 
    that is where they get their name from. </p> <br> <br>
