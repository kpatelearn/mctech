        <p>Planet Her has many differnt living things, apart from the civilisation, this planet has, mythic <br>
            fire dragons that are immune to cool surface waters and fire bred phoenixes made from ashes of <br>
            past relatives. 
            <br> <br>
            Mythic fire dragons: <br> <br>
            These creatures eat magic seaweed, they grow at the bottom of the ocean, and the dragons find <br>
            them since they have a sense that can see them from miles away since the magic seaweed glows <br>
            a bright green colour which helps the dragons find their way to their food <br>
            <br> 
            Fire bred phoenixes: <br> <br>
            The phoenixes on Planet Her, they are a orange color and are formed from the ashes of our past <br>
            family as a reminder that they are always watching. They usually are found sitting on the high <br>
            tree tops or soaring across the water <br>
