    <h1>OUR STORY!!!</h1>
    <img width="1000px" height="1900" src="10Mallnotification2.jpg">
<div id="origin">
    <p>As you can see above which is the image of a screenshot I took on my phone (Iphone 11pro) that morning is how our business called 'Cafe De Joy' all started.The notifications I got were about this 10Mall and vacant positions for shops were open and I Marie Grande felt like I needa a push into a career especially in my 3rd reminder I aspired to be the person who would finish uni early and started his own business. Recently I have been working at Wendys as a part timer but with these motivational notifications and reminder this morning made me quit my job and start a coffee business which was my dream when I was little. Straight away I called the management team and Manager/co-operator of the whole of the 10Mall 'K.P' and was able to open up my shop. Overtime each and every customer who visted spread the word about my shop to their friends and families and soon all my empty work positios I would do would be filled up with both new/noob and professional/pro workers. To all you dreamers out there I reccomend to go further than the limits set for you and exceedingly pass them. Heres a quote down below that I read everyday to myself and sometimes to my regulars (customers) and thanks to @reallygreatsite for assisting me in the process and development of my Website and for Starbucks for recently partnering up with me. #keepgoing #Lovecoffeeeee #CAFEDEJOY</p>
