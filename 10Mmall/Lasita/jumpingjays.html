<p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan, also known as Air Jordan, was a professional and collegiate basketball player from the United States who was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 17, 1963. He is regarded as one of the best all-around players in the history of the sport. Six National Basketball Association (NBA) titles were won by the Chicago Bulls under his leadership (1991–93, 1996–98).</p>

<p> Peter Moore created the Air Jordan I, which debuted in 1985 and cost $65 at the time of release. The 1985 release of the first Air Jordan served as the foundation for contemporary sneaker culture. Since then, Nike and the Jordan Brand have honoured this iconic shape by releasing it multiple times as the Retro 1.</p>
